## Welcome!

You've somehow stumbled across my site, (probably because I sent you a link). I created this blog as a way to share interesting tidbits I learn and things I'm still learning about. Nothing is quite as good a teacher as having to teach someone else.

My plan is to create articles about penetration tools and techniques, cyber-security news, HackTheBox writeups, bug bounty info and whatever else is interesting in the space. So bookmark the site and check back soon for new content. In the meantime if you want to chat reach out to me with the social links on the left. Thanks for stopping!
